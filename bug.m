This bug occurs when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  It's subtle because it doesn't always manifest, and often leads to crashes or unexpected behavior. The problem arises when an observer is added to an object that is deallocated before the observer is removed.  This can happen if the observer is a strong reference to the observed object (a common mistake), and the observed object's lifecycle is shorter than the observer's.

```objectivec
// Example of incorrect KVO setup:
@interface MyObserver : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) MyObservedObject *observedObject;
@end

@implementation MyObserver
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    // ... Handle KVO change ...
}
@end

@interface MyObservedObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myProperty;
@end

@implementation MyObservedObject

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
      [self addObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"myProperty" options:NSKeyValueObservingOptionNew context:nil];
    }
    return self;
}

- (void)dealloc{
   [self removeObserver:self.observer forKeyPath:@"myProperty"];
}

@end

```
